<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>
In 2022, I had the opportunity to be part of a winning team at the NASA Johnson Space Center Hackathon, where we won the Best Game Award ðŸ¥‡. Dodging In-game Asteroids Near Artemis ( D.I.A.N.A. ) was a free educational video game designed to inspire students about the upcoming Artemis missions through trivia questions and piloting the Orion spacecraft.

Now, I'm taking on the challenge of reimagining the game using C# and Unity. This project is not just about showcasing technical skills but about demonstrating growth, resilience, and passion for making education accessible to all. ðŸŽ“
